### Basic
- We only accept documentation that is proven to work on our LIVE API
- At least one approval is needed before pull requests can be merged
- All content is written in US English
- The terminology used must be in accordance with our naming conventions

### Text style
- Paths are formatted like: _Configuration → System → Plugin → MultiSafepay_
- Use single quotation marks in the front matter of markdown files (e.g., title: 'Title of the article')
- Use _italics_ when describing GUI elements (e.g., buttons, links and paths)
- When a sentence ends with an email address, don't use a period (e.g. "[...] contact us at <example@example.com>")

### Images
- Screenshot recommended sizes: Width: 820px - Height: auto

### Aliases
- When renaming or deleting a page, add an alias of the deprecated URL to the page users should be redirected to. This prevents external links from returning 404 errors. Check the [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#aliases) for more information.
