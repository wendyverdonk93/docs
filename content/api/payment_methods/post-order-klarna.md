* Direct transaction requires all fields completed properly

* All parameters shown are required field(s)

{{< alert-notice >}} __Please note__: In order for the shopping_cart to work correctly, the shipment item requires a special 'merchant_item_id'. This parameter is called 'msp-shipping' and can be seen in the JSON code. {{< /alert-notice >}}
