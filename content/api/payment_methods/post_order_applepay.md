## Apple Pay
Creates an Apple Pay [Redirect](/faq/api/difference-between-direct-and-redirect) order.

* Redirect transaction requires all fields completed properly.

__How to detect Apple Pay on a device__

```JavaScript
try {
    if (window.ApplePaySession && ApplePaySession.canMakePayments()) {
    console.log('ApplePay available');
    }
    } catch (error) {
    console.debug('An error occurred while verifying if Apple Pay is available:', error);
    }
```

If this code is not implemented in the front-end of you e-commerce platform, consumers choosing Apple Pay on the payment page will be displayed an error if their device does not support Apple Pay. We highly recommend using the abovementioned code to avoid any issues.

* All parameters shown are required field(s)
