## Authentication

All requests to the MultiSafepay API endpoint require authentication. Authentication is provided by including an API key as an HTTP header in your request. Each website has it's own API key so if you are operating multiple websites be sure to use the correct API key for each site. The API key can be found under the website settings in MultiSafepay Control.

The HTTP header name for the API Key is: **api_key**
