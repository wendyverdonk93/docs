### Redirect, Flexible 3D set on _false_

Flexible 3D is a feature that allows you to enable/disable 3D secure at API level. The Flexible 3D mandates whether or not a transaction should be completed with the 3D secure verification or not.

Credit card transactions which are processed with the 3D Secure protocol require a form of authentication of the customer during the payment process. Setting Flexible 3D to _false_ will disable the verfication process. 

**Activating Flexible 3D secure will override the rules of the Dynamic 3D settings, meaning that payments will not be enrolled with a 3D authentication.**

**__Please note__: MultiSafepay no longer supports [Flexible 3D](https://docs.multisafepay.com/tools/flexible_3d) with merchants based in Europe due to PSD2 regulations.**
