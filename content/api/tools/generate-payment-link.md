## Generating a payment link

For several scenarios, it can be useful for our merchants to generate a payment link. The payment link allows MultiSafepay Control to create a unique transaction that the payment can be matched with.

**Parameters**

----------------
__type__ | string

Specifies the payment flow for the checkout process. Fill in 'paymentlink'. It must be noted that orders with "type": "paymentlink" will be visible in the MultiSafepay Control under _Tools_ -> _Payment link generator_


----------------
__order_id__ | integer / string

The unique identifier from your system for the order. If the values are only numbers the type will be integer, otherwise it will be string.  Required. Max 50 char.  

----------------
__gateway__ (optional) | string 

The unique gateway id to immediately direct the customer to the payment method. You retrieve these gateways using a gateway request.

----------------
__currency__ | string

The currency [ISO-4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) you want the customer to pay with. 

----------------
__amount__ | integer

The amount (in cents) that the customer needs to pay.

----------------
__description__ | string

A text which will be shown with the order in MultiSafepay Control. If the customer's bank supports it this description will also be shown on the customer's bank statement. Max. 200 characters. HTML is not supported. Use the 'items' or 'shopping_cart' objects for this.

----------------

The rest of the fields are optional.
