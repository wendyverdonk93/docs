## Customize your E-mail template
With the MultiSafepay e-mailtemplate editor, it is possible to fully customize the e-mails that your customers will receive. Before you start customizing the mailing templates, we would like to advise you that you should have a basic to advanced understanding about the markup language HTML/CSS.

## Customize the E-mail template in pure HTML/CSS
In the editor you can switch the view to pure HTML/CSS by pressing the button Source in the second row of the editor. This will make it possible to create/edit a e-mail template with pure HTML/CSS code.

## Add a link to the E-mail template 
Our editor makes it possible to easily add in external links to your e-mail template.

- Navigate to the Body HTML editor on the e-mailtemplate page
- Press the Link icon in the first row of the template editor to add a external link to your template
- Choose between the link Type: URL, link to anchor in the text or e-mail link
- Fill in the additional fields based on which type you chose and press OK. 

## The use of tokens
With the use of our predefined tokens, it is possible to insert personalized details of your customers and webshop into the e-mails. This will improve the productivity of your e-mails and will save you a lot of time. 

A few examples of the placeholders you can use are: amount of the order, first and last name of the customer, payment method and the description of the order.

- Navigate to the Body HTML editor on the e-mailtemplate page

## Adding your own logo to the E-mail template

If you want to upload the your image to your merchant panel, go to the following link: merchant.multisafepay.com/payment-page-templates

## Adding a Inline frame to the E-mail template
An Iframe is an HTML document embedded inside another HTML document. You can use a IFrame to insert content from another source into the e-mail template.

## Merchant own responsibility 
MultiSafepay is not responsible for the customization of the e-mail templates. We provide every merchant with a standard set of templates which you can use immediately after creating a merchant account. It is important that you have some knowledge about HTML/CSS before you start with the customization of a e-mail template. Feel free to contact support if you have a question.
