A split payment can only be refunded from the original transaction. Whether the refund is paid in full or in part, the amount will be deducted from the original transaction.

For example: Account A receives a payment of 80 EUR of which 10 EUR is going to account B. The customer receives a refund of 50 EUR which is supplied from account A. Whether it is a partial refund or a full, the amount will always be deducted from account A. 

Please follow the following steps to refund a split payment transaction:

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Select _Transactions_ > _Transaction overview_
3. Find the transaction through search
4. Open transaction
5. Select _Refund_
6. Fill in the amount that you want to refund to the customer
7. _Confirm the refund._

By default, MultiSafepay does not allow you to refund more than the stated amount of the original transaction. However, refunding more than originally received, for example by refunding the return costs incurred by the customer, is now possible in your MultiSafepay Control. More information available on our FAQ section about [refunding more than original amount](/faq/finance/refund-more-than-original-amount)

The transaction status is now _initialized_. As long as the transaction status is marked as _initialized_, the refund can be cancelled. When the transaction status is marked as _completed_, the refund is processed correctly. The customer will receive the refund to the bank account number in which the transaction was originally paid to, within the next business day.
