## 1. Introduction
Recurring payments are automatic payments which enable you to charge a customer bank account or credit card on a regular basis. Your customers must initiate the first payment themselves. You must also take steps to make your customers aware that you will be charging them on a recurring basis. You can do this at the checkout process, but it is sufficient to include this in your General Terms & Conditions and require the customer to agree to those Terms & Conditions before checkout. You should also inform your customers in advance of each transaction. Recurring payments are a perfect solution for companies who charge their customers with a monthly or yearly subscription.

MultiSafepay supports two payment methods for recurring payments:

- Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard and American Express)
- SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) - optionally you can use iDEAL, Bancontact or SOFORT Banking for an initial payment and continue with recurring direct debits.

_We offer a workaround option to use Bancontact for an initial payment. [Contact](<mailto:sales@multisafepay.com>) your Account Manager for more information_.

Top 3 things you need to know before using recurring payments:

- Merchants are responsible for scheduling recurring payments and optional retries
- In order to use recurring payments, our Risk Team must specifically enable this functionality in your MultiSafepay Control
- Merchants are responsible for informing customers about commitment to frequent charges and storing mandates.
