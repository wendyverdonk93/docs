Recurring payments are not enabled by default in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).

Email requests to activate recurring payments to either:

- Your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>
- The Risk Team at <risk@multisafepay.com>

The default frequency limit for recurring payments is once every 24 hours per recurring ID.

To adjust this limit, email your reasoned request the Risk Team at <risk@multisafepay.com>
