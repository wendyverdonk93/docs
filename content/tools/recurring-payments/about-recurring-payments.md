Recurring payments let you automatically charge a customer's bank account or credit card on a regular basis, e.g. for a monthly or annual subscription. The customer must initiate the first payment.

## Supported payment methods
You can set up recurring payments for:

- Credit cards: Visa, Mastercard, and American Express
- SEPA Direct Debit 
- Optionally, you can use iDEAL, Bancontact, or SOFORT Banking for the initial payment and continue with recurring direct debits.

We offer a work-around option to use Bancontact for the initial payment. For more information, email your account manager at <sales@multisafepay.com>

## Requirements

You are responsible for scheduling recurring payments and optional retries.

You must inform customers about recurring payments and stored mandates:

- During the checkout process and/or in your general terms and conditions which the customer must agree to before checkout.
- Before each transaction.
