## Accountant Export
An Accountant Export containing all successful incoming and outgoing transactions, as well as corresponding costs (where applicable), can be generated to serve your bookkeeping needs. 

## Sending an Automated Accountant Export
As a MultiSafepay client, you can benefit from three ways of accessing/receiving the automated accountant export:

1. Via SFTP - Pull request _(With this method you will receive access to an SFTP server from MultiSafepay)_
2. Via SFTP - Push request _(With this method MultiSafepay would like to receive access to an SFTP server from you)_.
3. Transaction API using the [transactions API endpoint](/tools/transactions-api-endpoint/) (_The associated transaction costs are not included in the returned data_) 

We support SFTP by username/password and username/SSH keys.

_We only support port 22 & 2222 for SFTP connections_


## Requirements

__SFTP - Push Request: For SFTP reporting the following protocol is required:__

sh-ed25519,

rsa-sha2-256,
ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,

ssh-rsa

This must be supported on the SFTP server otherwise a report cannot be delivered.
