## How it works
MultiSafepay supports seamless integration with PayPal with the PayPal API. Funds are transferred directly to the merchant’s PayPal business account, while the transaction statuses and payment validation are managed by MultiSafepay. In order to integrate your PayPal Business account with MultiSafepay, the PayPal account API settings must be configured. Once the integration is completed, you can receive payments through this gateway by using one of our plugins or by implementing a custom integration with our API.

The transaction status refers to the status of the actual payment. MultiSafepay uses the order status for PayPal transactions. Since we do not collect the funds of completed PayPal transactions (as they are directly sent to your PayPal account), the financial status will remain _initialized_.

Please note the various descriptions of statuses and how they should be interpreted.

### Transaction flow
The transaction flow shows the different ways a transaction can be processed. This differs per payment method.

* Order status      
The order status indicates the status of the order, such as _completed_, _pending_ or _rejected_. The order status is independent of the incoming or outgoing payment of the transaction.

* Transaction status       
The transaction status indicates the payment status of the transaction, such as _completed_, _pending_ or _rejected_. Once the transaction status is _completed_, the amount of the transaction is added to your MultiSafepay balance.


| Order Status                   | Transaction Status         | Description |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initialized                    | Initialized              | A payment link has been generated, but no payment has been received yet.  | 
| Completed                      | Initialized              | A successful PayPal transaction has been received and the funds will be added to your PayPal balance.   | 
| Declined                       | Declined                 | Transaction has been rejected   | 
| Expired                        | Expired                  | An unfinished transaction will automatically expire after a predefined period.  | 
| Void                           | Cancelled                | Transaction has been cancelled.   | 
| Uncleared                      | Initialized                | An 'Uncleared' transaction without a reason is due to a configuration in your PayPal business account. The 'Uncleared' transactions are paid in a currency that is not enabled in your PayPal account. It is important to enable that specific currency in your PayPal account in order for the order status to change to 'Completed' in your MultiSafepay Control. |


### Refund flow


| Order Status                    | Transaction Status        | Description |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reserved                        | Initialized             | A refund has been requested. | 
| Completed                       | Initialized             | Refund has been successfully processed.  |
| Uncleared                       | Uncleared               | Refund has been initiated but PayPal account funds are insufficient. Refund will only be processed if funds are present.    |
