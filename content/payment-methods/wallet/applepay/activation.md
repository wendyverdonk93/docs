If you **don't** already have credit cards enabled, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Enable credit card payment methods in your MultiSafepay account. 

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/). 
2. Go to **Settings** > **Payment methods**.
3. Under **Standard payment methods**, select the **Maestro**, **Mastercard**, **Visa**, and **Apple Pay** checkboxes.
4. Click **Save changes**.

**Step 2:** Email your application to enable credit cards **and** Apply Pay as payment methods to the Risk Team at <risk@multisafepay.com> 

**Step 3:** Provide the following information:
