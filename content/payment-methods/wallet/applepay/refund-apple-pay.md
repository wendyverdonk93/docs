## Request refund

Please follow these steps to refund an Apple Pay transaction:

1. Select _transaction -> transaction overview_ in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Find the transaction through search
3. Open transaction
4. Select _refund_
5. Fill in the amount that you want to refund to the customer 
6. Confirm the refund.

The transaction and order status are now _initialized_. As long as the transaction and order status are marked as _initialized_, the refund can be cancelled. When the transaction status is marked as _completed_, the refund is processed correctly.

A refund will be processed on the Apple Pay account and credit card statement of the customer within the next business day. 

>_Outgoing payments will not be processed if your MultiSafepay balance is insufficient._

In the event of a failed Apple Pay refund, please contact our support team at <support@multisafepay.com> to assist you.
