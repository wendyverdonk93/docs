## What is it?
A SEPA Direct Debit is a financial transaction in which one entity withdraws funds from another's bank account by means of an automatic authorisation. Through SEPA Direct Debit, only payments from (IBAN) private banking can be processed, as a one-off or as a recurrent withdrawal. SOFORT Banking and iDEAL are supported as SEPA Direct Debit payment methods.

This payment method gives you the possibility to collect funds from your customer bank account on a recurring basis. SEPA Direct Debit is a standard across Europe to collect funds from your customers by means of previous authorization. Currently [36 countries](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/sites/default/files/kb/file/2020-01/EPC409-09%20EPC%20List%20of%20SEPA%20Scheme%20Countries%20v2.6%20-%20January%202020.pdf) fall under the SEPA scheme.
