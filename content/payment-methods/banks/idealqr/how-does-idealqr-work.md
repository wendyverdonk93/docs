## How it works
MultiSafepay supports seamless integration for iDEAL QR. As a merchant, you must either:

* Be able to able to retrieve and process the PNG image for the QR code on your side, in order to display it to the customer

    **or**

* Redirect the customer to our payment page where an iDEAL QR code will be displayed under _Payment methods:_

With iDEAL QR you can also produce a generic link that can be used multiple times. The QR code can be printed on leaflets. You can also enable an option to allow the customer change the amount.

> Please note that only 7 customer banks support iDEAL QR within their own banking app (Knab, Rabobank, ING and ABN AMRO). All other customers must use the dedicated iDEAL app.

### Transaction flow
The transaction flow shows the different ways a transaction can be processed. This differs per payment method.

* Order status      
The order status indicates the status of the order, such as _completed_, _pending_ or _rejected_. The order status is independent of the incoming or outgoing payment of the transaction.

* Transaction status       
The transaction status indicates the payment status of the transaction, such as _completed_, _pending_ or _rejected_. Once the transaction status is _completed_, the amount of the transaction is added to your MultiSafepay balance.


| Order Status                      | Transaction Status      | Description |
|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initialized | Initialized | A payment link has been generated, but no payment has been received yet.  | 
| Completed   | Completed   | A successful iDEAL QR transaction has been received and the funds will be added to your MultiSafepay Control balance.   | 
| Expired     | Expired     | An unfinished transaction will automatically expire after a predefined period.  | 
| Void        | Cancelled    | Transaction has been cancelled.   | 


#### Refund flow 

| Order Status                      | Transaction Status      | Description |
|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initialized    | Initialized | A refund has been requested. | 
| Completed      | Completed   | Refund has been successfully processed.  |

### Product rules
Some rules may apply to certain payment methods. For iDEAL QR, the following rules apply:

* Refunding more than the stated amount of the original transaction is possible with iDEAL QR. More information is available on our [refund more than original amount](/faq/finance/refund-more-than-original-amount) page

* Successful iDEAL transactions have no expiring date regarding refunding, as long as the receiving bank is able to process the refund

* Payments done through iDEAL QR are processed in [Euros (EUR)](/faq/general/which-currencies-are-supported-by-multisafepay)

* If you would like to test iDEAL QR, please note that this will only work in a _Live_ environment. The _Testing_ environment is __not__ available.

* The lifetime of an iDEAL QR payment is by default 30 days active, but this can be adjusted. Read more about the days_active and seconds_active parameters on the [Lifetime of a payment link](/faq/api/lifetime-of-a-payment-link/)

* The payment amount that can be set for an iDEAL QR transaction depends on the min_amount and max_amount parameters sent in the payment request. For more information, read our API section on [iDEAL QR](/api/#ideal-qr)

* A single iDEAL QR code can be used more than once and generate more than one payment linked to a single Order ID, therefore subsequent transactions will each have a unique Order ID.
