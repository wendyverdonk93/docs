## Request refund
Please follow these steps to refund a TrustPay transaction:

1. Select _transaction -> transaction overview_ in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
2. Find the transaction through search
3. Open transaction
4. Select _refund_
5. Fill in the amount that you want to refund to the customer       
6. Confirm the refund.

>_Please note that by default, MultiSafepay does not allow for you to refund more than the stated amount of the original transaction. Please refer to the [product rules](/payment-methods/banks/trustpay/#product-rules) for more information._

The transaction status is now _initialized_. As long as the transaction status is marked as _initialized_, the refund can be cancelled. When the transaction status is marked as _completed_, the refund is processed correctly. The customer will receive the refund to the bank account number in which the transaction was originally paid to, within the next business day.

A refund will only be processed if your balance on your MultiSafepay Control is positive.

In the event of a failed TrustPay refund, please contact our support team at <support@multisafepay.com> to assist you.
