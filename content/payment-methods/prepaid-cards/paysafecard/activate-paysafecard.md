* When buying your Paysafecard PIN, choose 10, 25, 50 or 100 EUR
* The value of the PIN code is immediately and entirely at your disposal
* If you do not fully use the value of a PIN when you pay, the residual credit will remain available for you to use later
* If you have not used up the balance in the first 12 months, then from the 13th month, you will be charged a monthly administration fee of 3 EUR of the residual balance.
