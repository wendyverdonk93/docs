## Request refund
If a refund of a gift card payment has been requested, you could do so through your own banking environment, as follows:

* A transaction fully paid with Paysafecard can not be reimbursed through MultiSafepay, due to missing bank account details of the customer. We advise you to proceed with the refund via your own banking environment

* A transcation partially paid with a gift card and partially paid with a different method (e.g. iDEAL), can be fully reimbursed to the customer

The amount deducted from a Paysafecard card to pay an order is not processed or received by MultiSafepay. MultiSafepay only receives a status notification of a successful payment.
