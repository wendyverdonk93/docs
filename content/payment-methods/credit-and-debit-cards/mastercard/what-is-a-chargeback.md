## Chargeback
Customers who disagree with or do not recognise a transaction that is charged to their credit card can ask the card issuing bank to raise a dispute. If a dispute is raised, the card scheme, in this case Mastercard, will notify MultiSafepay and reclaim the transaction amount from the merchant.

A cardholder can claim a chargeback for a minimum of 180 days after the purchase based on their customer rights given by Mastercard.
