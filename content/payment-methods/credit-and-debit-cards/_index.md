{{< details title="About credit and debit cards" >}}

Credit and debit cards are plastic cards issued by a bank, building society, or card scheme that let the cardholder pay for products or services at a point of sale, online, or on a mobile app. Cardholders can also withdraw cash, or link their card to digital wallets or other local payment methods.

Credit cards are a very common payment method in many countries. Their widespread acceptance, ease of use, and ability to process payments in multiple currencies make them the ideal choice for many customers.

Cards may feature:

- A card number to uniquely identify the card
- A 3-4 digit card verification code (CVC) for additional security
- An expiry date 
- The cardholder's name
