{{< details title="V Pay refund rules" >}}

- You cannot refund more than the amount of the original transaction.

- The maximum refund period is 180 days. After this period, we recommend processing refunds by bank transfer.

- While the transaction status is **Initialized**, you can cancel the refund. Once the status changes to **Completed**, the refund has been processed. 

- Refunds are only processed if there are enough funds in your MultiSafepay balance.

- The customer receives the refund in the bank account they originally paid from within the next business day.
