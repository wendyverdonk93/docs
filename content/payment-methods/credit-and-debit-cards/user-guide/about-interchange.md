Banks and card schemes all charge different fees to cover the operational costs of managing their network and processing credit card payments.

There are three cost components for the [Interchange++ model](/payment-methods/credit-and-debit-cards/mastercard/user-guide/about-interchange/):
- The Interchange fee that is paid to the issuing bank
- The scheme fee charged by Visa or Mastercard
- The acquirer fee 

These costs vary considerably depending on a range of factors, including the:
- Merchant's country
- Issuing bank 
- Cardholder 
- Merchant segment
- Monthly transaction volume 

When you create a MultiSafepay account, we provide an estimate of these costs.

## Speciic transaction costs
The actual cost of a specific transaction is difficult to predict. Fees differ per transaction, based on factors such as the:

* Country where the card was issued
* Country where the transaction is processed
* Type of card, e.g. corporate or customer card
* Way the card is processed, e.g. level of security
* Amount of the transaction

To ensure transparency, payment service providers can choose the Interchange++ pricing model, which breaks down the costs for each transaction. There are no preset prices, instead the fee is calculated based on the total cost of all transactions processed.
