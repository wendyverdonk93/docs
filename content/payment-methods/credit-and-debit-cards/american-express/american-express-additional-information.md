### American Express, additional information 
> American Express is protected by its own branded [3D Secure](/faq/general/glossary/#3d-secure), the American Express Safekey. All transactions processed via this payment method are verified through the Safekey, except transactions lower than 30 EUR.

> Credit card payments are not fully guaranteed. Customers can withdraw the transaction, due to their customer right protection of the credit card schemes. The accountability​ of accepting credit card payments lies entirely with the merchant.

> Payments with American Express can be completed only in Euros (EUR), American Dollars (USD) or British Pounds (GBP).

> When using your own MID (MerchantID) from American Express, the funds are not processed by MultiSafepay. Instead, they will be added to your own balance at American Express. You will be automatically added to the Safekey directory. All currencies will be possible. For more information, please contact the support team at <support@multisafepay.com>

> Credit card payments are not fully guaranteed. Customers can withdraw the transaction, due to their customer right protection of VISA and Mastercard. The accountability​ of accepting credit card payments lies entirely with the Merchant. 

> American Express is a premium product and falls in a different category other than Visa and Mastercard. This is why American Express requires a separate application with MultiSafepay.
