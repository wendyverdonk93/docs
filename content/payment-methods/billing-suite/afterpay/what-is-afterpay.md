# What it is

AfterPay is the largest online post-payment service in the Netherlands and has recently also launched in Belgium. This payment method allows customers to pay for online purchases after receiving them. 
A special feature of post-payment is that customers are only charged for the items they keep from an order. Following the arrival of an order, the customer is e-mailed an invoice with a standard payment period of 14 days. The outstanding amount can be paid by iDeal or transferred via internet banking. 

> _Currently, MultiSafepay offers AfterPay for the Netherlands and Belgium._

Check the [Activate](/payment-methods/billing-suite/afterpay/#activate) section for a complete list of requirements to process Afterpay transactions.
