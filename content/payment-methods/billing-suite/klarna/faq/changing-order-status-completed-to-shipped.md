Klarna does not support auto-ship functionality, so after you ship the order to the customer, you need to change the order status from **Completed** to **Shipped**. This prevents the order expiring, and lets Klarna initiate the billing process with the customer and pay the transaction out to your MultiSafepay balance. You can do this:

- Automatically using our [API](https://docs.multisafepay.com/api/#update-an-order), which updates your MultiSafepay Control 
- Automatically in your [ecommerce integration](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations)
- Manually in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)

To change the order status manually, follow these steps:

- Log in to your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
- Go to **Transactions** > **Transactions overview**.
- Search for the transaction, and click to open the **Transaction details** page. 
- Under **Order details**, click **Change order status**. 
- Change the status to **Shipped**.
- Send the customer the Track & Trace details, if relevant.
