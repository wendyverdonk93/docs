For every transaction, Klarna generates:

- A reservation number for while the order is not yet activated. Use this as a reference number when contacting Klarna with any questions at this stage.
- An invoice number when the order status changes to **Shipped**.

Both numbers appear in the relevant **Transaction details** page in your MultiSafepay Control.
