Klarna is an online post-payment method that lets customers pay for orders after receiving them. Customers are only charged for the items they keep from an order. 

{{< alert-notice >}} **Note:** As of October 1, 2020 Klarna Payment Method (KPM) is superceded by Klarna Payments. We recommend migrating as soon as possible. Prior to the full decommission of Klarna, new transactions will be disabled at one point and finally refunds will only be available for short period thereafter. Please contact [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/nl/zakelijk/webwinkelsupport) in order to upgrade to the new Klarna integration.  {{< /alert-notice >}}
