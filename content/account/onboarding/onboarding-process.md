Onboarding is the process of MultiSafepay checking and approving information submitted by merchants and partners applying for a live account.

To onboard with MultiSafepay and start processing real transactions, follow these steps:  

## 1. Sign up for a live account 
Complete the live account [sign up form](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup).

## 2. Provide documents and information

You can upload all required documents and information in your MultiSafepay test account under [Business details](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/onboarding):

* Company details:  
    - Address
    - VAT number
    - Chamber of Commerce number
* The URL of any websites you receive payments through 
* Information about the [ultimate beneficial owners](/account/ubo-form/) (UBOs) of your company, including color scans of valid identity documents. 
    We recommend using the [KopieID app](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/identiteitsfraude/vraag-en-antwoord/veilige-kopie-identiteitsbewijs) to hide personal information on passports or IDs.
* A payment of 1 EUR from your business bank account. Alternatively, you can provide a copy or screenshot of a bank statement that includes your IBAN and company name.

We may ask you to provide additional documents, e.g. if you have an unusual company structure.

**Note:** The trade name of your business bank account must exactly match at least one of the trade names listed on your Chamber of Commerce extract.

### Credit card payments
If you want to process credit card payments, you must provide your:

* Minimum, average, and maximum order value
* Annual turnover from credit card transactions

**Note:** Requests to process credit cards may be denied, e.g. if a [product you sell is prohibited](/faq/getting-started/prohibited-products-and-services/) by the processing bank.

### Prohibited products and services

Some products and services can't be sold with MultiSafepay, or only if additional requirements are met. For a list, based on relevant legislation, risk factors, potential reputational damage, and payment gateway policies, see [Prohibited products and services](/faq/getting-started/prohibited-products-and-services/).

## 3. Display required information on your website

You must display the following information on your website:

* Full legal company name, address, phone number, and email address
* Chamber of Commerce number
* VAT number
* General terms and conditions, including the right to withdrawal (14 days)
* Privacy policy

## Screening and approval
The Risk Team screens your information and performs [know your customer checks](/account/kyc/).

If approved, your account goes live.
