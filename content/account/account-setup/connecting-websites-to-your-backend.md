To connect a website in your [backend](/getting-started/glossary/#backend):

Most MultiSafepay [ecommerce integrations](/integrations/ecommerce-integrations) require your API key, site ID, secure code, and account ID to connect to a website. Your account ID appears in the top-right corner of your MultiSafepay account. If you are building your own integration using our API, SDK, or wrapper, use the API key under your website settings.

1. Enter the required details in the backend of your integration.

2. The connection is finalized.

3. [Place a test order](https://docs.multisafepay.com/api/#orders) using our API to validate the connection.
