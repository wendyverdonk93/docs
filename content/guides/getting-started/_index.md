Welcome to MultiSafepay. We break down barriers and remove obstacles for commerce by providing smart payment solutions. Our core services allow you to accept payments, manage transactions and stimulate online sales. On top of that, we provide a suite of tools to boost conversion rates, create the perfect checkout experience and gain financial insights.

You can start processing payments in five easy steps:

## Step 1: Create a test account
To create a test account, follow these steps:

1. Fill out the signup form to [create a free test account](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/signup)
2. Open the email containing your **security code**
3. [Log in](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com) using the **security code** provided in the email

With a test account:

* You can build and test your payment integration
* You can explore new features
* No costs are associated with transactions

For support, email the Customer Operations Team at <support@multisafepay.com>

## Step 2: Set up your MultiSafepay Control
After successfully creating a test account, it is time to set up your MultiSafepay Control. With MultiSafepay Control, you can generate your [API key](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#api-key), monitor transactions, configure payouts, generate reports, and more. 

Before you can start building your integration, add your website to MultiSafepay Control to generate an API key.

To add your website, follow these steps:

1. [Log in](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com) to your MultiSafepay Control
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Website settings**
3. Click **Website wizard** and add your domain

Your test account is now linked to your website. Navigate to the [website settings](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/sites), click your website, and copy the API key to start building your integration.

To learn more about setting up your MultiSafepay Control, see MultiSafepay Control - [Add website](/tools/multisafepay-control/add-website)

## Step 3: Build your integration
With an API key, you can start building and testing your integration. We offer multiple integration methods. Make sure you choose a method that matches your business needs and tech stack. Our integration methods can roughly be divided into two categories.  

### Ready-made solutions
These solutions are made by our in-house developers. They include plugins, apps and core integrations for many leading ecommerce platforms like Magento, WooCommerce, Shopify, and Lightspeed. These solutions require fewer development resources and allow you to start testing your integration today.

{{< /buttons >}}

### Custom-built integrations
Build your own integration using our API, SDK's or wrappers. Generally, this requires more development resources. However, these methods provide full control over your checkout experience's look, feel, and functionality. Use these integration methods when you build your own ecommerce website or app.

### Other integration methods
* [Cash register software](/integrations/cash-register-software): simplify the order process for restaurants, cafes, hotels, and establishments alike
* [Reservation Management](/integrations/reservation-management): allow your customers to make reservations and pay online
* [Credit & Subscription Management](/integrations/credit-and-subscription-management): manage your subscriptions and collect your subscription fees

For help determining the best integration method for your business, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

## Step 4: Go live
When you are ready, [sign up for a live account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup) to begin processing real transactions.

MultiSafepay is a [payment service provider](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#payment-service-provider-psp) and [acquirer](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#acquirer). Therefore, we are legally required to perform know your customer (KYC) checks on your account. You can supply the information we need to activate your account through your MultiSafepay Control. 

To learn more, read our documentation about [onboarding](/faq/getting-started/onboarding/).

If you need help creating a live account, email our Sales Team at <sales@multisafepay.com>


## Step 5: Next steps
Now that you're successfully processing payments, it's time to get the most out of our products. Start using our [Tools](https://docs.multisafepay.com/tools) to boost conversion, improve security, gain insights, and more.
