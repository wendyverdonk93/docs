## Adding a new business bank account
To add a new business bank account for payouts, add the new IBAN in your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).

To verify the account:

- Make a payment of 1 EUR from the business bank account, **or**
- Provide a copy of a bank statement, **or**
- Provide a screenshot of your online banking environment, including IBAN and company name. 

**Note:** The company name on your bank statement must exactly match one of the trade names on your chamber of commerce extract.

MultiSafepay verifies the new bank account within 5 business days. We only accept business bank accounts (no private bank accounts) that are registered to the official company name.
