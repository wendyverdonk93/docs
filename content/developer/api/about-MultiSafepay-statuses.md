There are two statuses in your [MultiSafepay account](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) that update as payments are processed. 

**Order status**  
The progression of the customer's order with you, independent of the payment, e.g. whether you have shipped the items.   
API attribute: `status`

**Transaction status**  
The progression towards settling the funds in your MultiSafepay balance.  
API attribute: `financial_status`

Statuses are also valuable for understanding [reports](/business/accounting/reports/).

## Viewing statuses

To view statuses in your MultiSafepay account, go to **Transaction overview** > **Transaction details** page, under **Status history**. 

## Status meanings

The meaning of statuses (or combinations of statuses) varies per payment method. To check specific meanings, see the relevant [payment method](/payments/methods/) page. 

The table below sets out possible order and transaction statuses and what they commonly mean.

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| Initialized | A payment link has been generated, but the customer hasn't yet completed payment. |
| Shipped | You have shipped the order and the funds can be captured. |
| Uncleared | The customer has completed payment, but the funds are not yet settled. You may need to manually [authorize or decline the transaction](/faq/finance/evaluating-uncleared-card-transactions/), or the [issuer](/getting-started/glossary/#issuer) is authorizing it. |
| Completed | - **Order:** The customer has completed payment and settlement is guaranteed. Proceed with shipment. {{< br >}} - **Transaction:** The funds are settled in your MultiSafepay balance. |
| Declined | The [issuer](/getting-started/glossary/#issuer) or [acquirer](/getting-started/glossary/#acquirer) has declined the transaction. {{< br >}} See also [About Declined status](/payments/methods/credit-and-debit-cards/user-guide/declined-status/). |
| Void / Cancelled | You have canceled the transaction. |
| Expired | The customer didn't complete payment and the transaction expired. |

### Refunds and chargebacks

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
|Initialized | The customer has requested a refund.|
| Chargeback | The customer has requested a [chargeback](/payments/chargebacks/).|
| Completed | The refund or chargeback has been  processed successfully. |
| Declined | The payment method has declined the refund request. |
