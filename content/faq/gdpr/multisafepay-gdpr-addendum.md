MultiSafepay's primary activity is processing online payments. We are a data controller, responsible for storing data only. We are **not** a processor or sub-processor of data. 

For more information, see the MultiSafepay - [GDPR Addendum](https://www.multisafepay.com/downloads/Addendum_GDPR_2018.pdf). It includes a number of provisions similar to a standard processing agreement.
