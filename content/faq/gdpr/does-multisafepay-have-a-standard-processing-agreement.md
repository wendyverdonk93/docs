Since online payments processing is the primary activity of MultiSafepay, we are a data controller, responsible for keeping it, and not a so-called (sub)processor, responsible for processing it any way. For this reason, we have added an [addendum](https://www.multisafepay.com/downloads/Addendum_GDPR_2018.pdf), which includes a number of provisions similar to a processing agreement.
