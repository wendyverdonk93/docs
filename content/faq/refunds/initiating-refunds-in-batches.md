You can initiate refunds in batches using our refund script. The script requires 2 parameters: 

1. A .csv file that specifies the order ID, amount, and description of every transaction
2. Your [API key](/faq/general/glossary/#api-key)

The script is written in PHP, so make sure you have a PHP interpreter installed.

For instructions on using the script and to download, see MultiSafepay GitHub - [Refund script](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/refund-script).
