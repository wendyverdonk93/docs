It is possible to easily refund in batches with our refund script. The refund script takes two parameters: 

1. A .csv file which specifies the order_id, amount and description of every order
2. Your API key. 

The script is written in PHP, so make sure it's used in an environment where a PHP interpreter is installed.

To download the refund script and find more instructions on its usage, visit our [Github page](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/refund-script)
