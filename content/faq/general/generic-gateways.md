In our plugins, we use predefined gateways for specific payment methods. Whenever we support a new gateway, merchants need to update their plugin to use the new gateway. For that reason, some of our plugins use one or more generic gateways. These gateways have a flexible gateway code that allows them to connect to almost every payment method we offer, without updating the plugin.

### Generic gift cards 

Since we don't support closed-loop gift cards and not all open-loop gift cards in our ecommerce integrations, generic gateways can be particularly useful for gift cards.
In some integrations, we use special gateways that act as generic gift card gateways.

For more information about integrating both open-loop and closed-loop gift cards in our platform, email the Integration Team at <integration@multisafepay.com>

### Limitations

We only support redirect gateways.
