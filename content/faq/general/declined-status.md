## Declined
Credit card payments may receive the status **Declined** for several reasons. Only the customer can contact their credit card issuer to find out why.

For questions about credit card payments and payment statuses, email the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>.

In most cases, merchants can see the reason the payment was declined in the declined transaction status in your MultiSafepay Control. 

| Transaction status | Reason | Description |
------- |----------|---------|
Declined | Transaction not allowed | MultiSafepay's fraud filter has declined the transaction. For more information, email the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>.
Declined | Do not honour | The reason has not been shared with MultiSafepay. Only the card holder can contact their issuing bank to find out why.
Declined | 3D authorisation cancelled | The 3D secure verification may be incomplete or could not be validated.
Declined | Expired card | The customer's credit card has expired.
Declined | Insufficient funds | The customer has insufficient credit on their card to complete the payment.
Declined | Merchant only accepts 3DS verified cards | "Declined, not verified". If you want to accept unverified 3D cards, email the Risk Team at <risk@multisafepay.com>.
