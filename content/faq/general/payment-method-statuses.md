Every payment has an Order Status as well as a Transaction Status relating to a single order transaction. This section outlines the transaction flow of an order and the different ways a transaction can be processed. This differs per payment method.

* Order Status: The order status indicates the status of the order, such as _Completed_, _Pending_ or _Rejected_.

* Transaction Status: The transaction status indicates the payment status of the transaction, such as _Completed_, _Pending_ or _Rejected_. Once the transaction status is _Completed_, the amount of the transaction is added to your MultiSafepay balance.
