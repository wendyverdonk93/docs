As a [merchant](/faq/general/glossary/#merchant), you are required to verify customers' age when _selling_ or _delivering_ orders that include alcohol. As a PSP, MultiSafepay must ensure that merchants comply with relevant legislation and that your customers meet the requirements for purchasing alcohol.

### Requirements

Dutch law states that alcohol cannot be sold to customers under the age of 18. If you sell alcohol, you must state this clearly on your website. When orders are delivered, customers must show a valid identification document stating their date of birth. The following documents are accepted:

* Passport
* Dutch driving license
* European or Dutch ID card

Merchants must also submit a Merchant declaration regarding alcoholic beverages (once only). Email a signed copy of the declaration to the Risk Team at <risk@multisafepay.com>
