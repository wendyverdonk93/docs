Onboarding refers to the steps you need to follow to create and active a MultiSafepay account. When you [sign up](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup), we perform several _know your customer_ checks on the:

* Account holder
* Associated bank account
* Merchant
* Associated website

To help you process payments as quickly as possible, we divide the onboarding checks into two phases:

* **Identification**: Once we have established the identity of the account holder, you can start collecting customer payments.
* **Verification**: Once we have verified the identity of the account holder, you can receive payouts to your business bank account.

## Know your customer checks

### Documents and information

You can upload all of the required documents and information in your MultiSafepay Control > [Business details](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/onboarding):

* Company details including address, VAT number, and Chamber of Commerce number
* A link to the website you receive payments through, if used 
* Information about the [ultimate beneficial owners](https://docs.multisafepay.com/faq/getting-started/ultimate-beneficial-owner-form/) of your company, including color scans of valid identity documents. We recommend using the [KopieID app](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/identiteitsfraude/vraag-en-antwoord/veilige-kopie-identiteitsbewijs) to hide personal information on passports or IDs.
* A payment of 1 EUR from your business bank account. Alternatively, you can provide a copy or screenshot of a bank statement that includes your IBAN and company name.

The trade name of your business bank account must exactly match at least one of the trade name listed on your Chamber of Commerce extract.

**Note:** The documents and information mentioned above are the standard requirements for performing a check. We may ask you to provide additional documents, e.g. for an unusual company structure.

### Credit card payments
To process credit card payments, you must provide your:

* Minimum order value
* Average order value
* Maximum order value
* Annual turnover in credit card transactions

**Note:** Requests to process credit cards may be denied, e.g. if a particular product is not allowed by the processing bank.

### Merchant website

In addition to the required information and documents, you must list the following information on your website:

* Chamber of Commerce number
* VAT number
* General terms and conditions, including the right to withdrawal (14 days)
* Privacy policy
* Full legal company name, company address, phone number, and email address

### Prohibited products and services

Some products and services can't be sold with MultiSafepay or only if additional requirements are met. For a list, based on relevant legislation, risk factors, potential reputational damage, and payment gateway policies, see [Prohibited products and services](/faq/getting-started/prohibited-products-or-services/).
