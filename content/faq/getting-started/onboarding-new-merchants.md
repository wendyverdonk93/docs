Onboarding refers to the steps you need to follow to [sign up](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup) for a live MultiSafepay account. You need to provide information about your company structure, and your products and services. We then perform know your customer (KYC) checks on the:

* Account holder
* Business bank account
* Merchant
* Website

## Know your customer checks
To help you start accepting payments as quickly as possible, we divide our KYC checks into two phases:

* Identification: When we have established the identity of the account holder, you can start accepting payments.
* Verification: When we have verified the identity of the account holder, you can receive payouts to your business bank account.

### Documents and information

You can upload all required documents and information in your MultiSafepay Control - [Business details](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/onboarding):

* Company details, including address, VAT number, and Chamber of Commerce number
* The URL of the website you receive payments through, if relevant 
* Information about the [ultimate beneficial owners](/faq/getting-started/ultimate-beneficial-owner-form/) of your company, including color scans of valid identity documents. We recommend using the [KopieID app](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/identiteitsfraude/vraag-en-antwoord/veilige-kopie-identiteitsbewijs) to hide personal information on passports or IDs.
* A payment of 1 EUR from your business bank account. Alternatively, you can provide a copy or screenshot of a bank statement that includes your IBAN and company name.

We may ask you to provide additional documents, e.g. if you have an unusual company structure.

**Note:** The trade name of your business bank account must exactly match at least one of the trade names listed on your Chamber of Commerce extract.

### Credit card payments
To process credit card payments, you must provide your:

* Minimum, average, and maximum order value
* Annual turnover from credit card transactions

**Note:** Requests to process credit cards may be denied, e.g. if a [product you sell is prohibited](/faq/getting-started/prohibited-products-and-services/) by the processing bank.

### Required information on your website

In addition to the required documents and information, you must display the following information on your website:

* Full legal company name, address, phone number, and email address
* Chamber of Commerce number
* VAT number
* General terms and conditions, including the right to withdrawal (14 days)
* Privacy policy

### Prohibited products and services

Some products and services can't be sold with MultiSafepay or only if additional requirements are met. For a list, based on relevant legislation, risk factors, potential reputational damage, and payment gateway policies, see [Prohibited products and services](/faq/getting-started/prohibited-products-and-services/).
