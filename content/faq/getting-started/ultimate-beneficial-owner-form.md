MultiSafepay is legally required under the Wwft to establish and verify the identity of each merchant enterprise's ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs).

## What is an ultimate beneficial owner?

A UBO is the natural person who directly or indirectly holds an equity interest in or exercises control of the enterprise. Most commonly, an individual holds an equity interest of 25% or more of the shares or capital of the enterprise, or exercises:
* 25% or more of the voting rights, or
* de facto control over the affairs of the enterprise, or
* other special rights of 25% or more over the capital of the enterprise and specific control over, for example, rights granted in the pages of incorporation.

* [French UBO form](/faq/getting-started/form/UBOform_FR.pdf)
* [German UBO form](/faq/getting-started/form/UBOform_DE.pdf)

## Example of completed form
* The limited company Good Ltd has a sole shareholder Better Ltd.

The shares of Better Ltd. are held equally by two other limited companies:

* Anders Ltd. which has two equal shareholders:
Mr A. Jansen
Ms B. Jansen - de Jong

* Best Ltd. which has one sole shareholder:
Ms D. Best

The three ultimate beneficial owners are therefore:
* Mr A. Jansen
* Ms B. Jansen - de Jong
* Ms D. Best

Provide the details of all UBOs in the Statement of ultimate beneficial owner form. Upload in your MultiSafepay Control color copies of the identity documents of all UBOs.

## Enterprise group structures

If the enterprise consists of a number of (intermediate) holding companies, then the UBO(s) are all the individuals who, through various companies, have 25% or more control of the underlying enterprise.

## Does every enterprise have an ultimate beneficial owner?

No. Under the law, enterprises are not required to have a UBO. For example, if an enterprise has five owners with an equal distribution of capital and control, none of them owns 25% or more of the enterprise.
