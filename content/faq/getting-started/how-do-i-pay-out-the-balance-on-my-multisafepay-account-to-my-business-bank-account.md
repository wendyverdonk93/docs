In order to withdraw your balance from your MultiSafepay Control and transfer it to your own business bank account, your documentation and the information on your website needs to be checked and approved by our Risk Team.

You will automatically receive an email once your account has been approved. Please keep in mind that you can already process payments from your customers as soon as you have created an account and implemented your website. Your funds will be held on your MultiSafepay Control pending the approval of your account.

You can choose to pay out the balance on your MultiSafepay Control manually or automatically.
