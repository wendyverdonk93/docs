To withdraw the balance from your MultiSafepay Control account and transfer it to your business bank account, your MultiSafepay Control account must be fully activated. To check this:

1. Log in to [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com).
2. From the left-hand dashboard, select **Pay-out**.
3. If your account is not fully activated, a red bar appears at the top of the screen with a link to the page for uploading the documents required to approve your account.

The Risk Team then checks and approves your documentation and the information on your website. Once approved, we will send you an email that your account is fully activated. 

Note that you can process customer payments immediately after creating a MultiSafepay Control account and implementing your website. But your funds will be held in your MultiSafepay Control account until it is fully activated.

You can choose to pay out your MultiSafepay Control balance manually or automatically.
