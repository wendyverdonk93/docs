Refunding more than the stated amount of the original transaction is now possible for certain payment methods and can be activated in MultiSafepay Control. This can be useful, for example, for merchants willing to cover the costs incurred by a customer when sending an order back by post. 

This only applies to payments originally received with a debit payment method. **Credit cards and post-payment methods do not apply.**

Please note that refunding amounts larger than the initial order value **needs to be approved by the Risk Team** that will also set a maximum limit. Once approved, the Risk Team will enable the _allow more than original_ function in your MultiSafepay Control App, from where you can now activate it. 

The application must be submitted through your account manager, that you can contact at <sales@multisafepay.com>
