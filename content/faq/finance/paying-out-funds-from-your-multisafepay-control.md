You can pay out funds from your MultiSafepay Control to your business bank account any time, except if:

- Your MultiSafepay Control account is not yet fully activated. 
- Your account balance is negative.
- The Risk Team has deactivated this feature for any reason. 

To make a payout to a different bank account than the one activated in your MultiSafepay Control, you must first add it under **Business documents**.

## Payout fees
Payouts cost 0.50 EUR per pay out.

## Automatic and manual pay outs 
You can pay out funds automatically or manually.

### Automatic

To schedule automatic payouts, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) account.
2. Select **Finance** > **Balance**.
3. Select the IBAN number you want to pay out to.
4. Schedule your pay outs.

The payout scheduler lets you:

 * Schedule automatic withdrawals on preferred days of the week.
 * Schedule payments only when your MultiSafepay Control balance exceeds a specific amount.
 * Reserve a specific amount in your MultiSafepay Control, e.g. for a refund.

### Manual

To make manual payouts, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) account.
2. Select **Finance** > **Balance**.
3. Select an amount to pay out, the currency, and the IBAN number to pay out to.

## Payout processing time 
The time taken to process payouts is determined by the Risk Team. The default payout delay is 1 day. Payouts may take up to three business days to arrive in your business bank account.

Payment batches are not processed on weekends. That is, payouts initiated on Fridays are processed on Monday morning.

Not all banks have instant payments and therefore may take extra time to process payments.

On some bank holidays, banks don't process outgoing payments. For example, see the [Deutsche Bank schedule for the Netherlands](https://www.deutschebank.nl/nl/content/producten_en_services_services_international_holidays_2017.html).

**Automatic:** Assuming default settings, if you schedule a payout on Monday, the payout batch includes all payments up to 23:59 hours on the Monday night. The payout batch is sent to MultiSafepay's bank on Tuesday morning. Our bank processes the batch and transfers the pay out to your business bank account. You should receive the payout on Tuesday afternoon.

**Manual:** The status of the pay out is **Reserved** for 24 hours before it is added to our bankâ€™s payout batch in the morning. Then, the payout is transferred to your business bank account. Manual payouts usually take longer to process than automatic ones.

## Negative MultiSafepay Control balance
If the balance on your MultiSafepay Control is negative (e.g. due to refunds, chargebacks, or fees), payouts are paused until sufficient funds are available. Always set a "reserved balance" in your payout settings to prevent payout and/or refund delays.
