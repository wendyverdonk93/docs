| 1034  | Cannot refund transaction | This error occurs when a requested refund cannot be completed  <a name="1035"></a>                                                                 | 1. The transaction has already been refunded <br> 2. The transaction has been cancelled <br> 3. Several partial refunds have been requested and the sum of the partial refunds exceeds the original transaction amount   <br> 4. Withdrawals are not allowed for this merchant due to blocked outgoing payments.<br> 5. 'Same refund done in short period': A second refund for the same amount within 5 minutes is rejected by MultiSafepay as safety against double processing.<br> 6. Refunds sent in a batch via the API will cause this error because the process is too quick. It is therefore necessary to [delay the refund](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/refund-script) requests with a minimum of 1 second to avoid the error occurring.                       |
