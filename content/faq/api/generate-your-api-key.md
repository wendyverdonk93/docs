An API key is required to successfully establish a connection between your [website](/faq/getting-started/glossary/#website) and the MultiSafepay services.

An API key can only be requested when a website URL is inputted into the backend of the MultiSafepay interface. Thus, an API key will only be generated as long as the field contains the URL of your website. Only then will it be possible to process data and payments.

It is not possible to generate an API key in any other way e.g. ERP systems. An export of all transactions via SFTP can be made with the Accountant Export to serve your bookkeeping needs. An automatic [Accountant Export](/tools/reports/automatic-reports) can also be requested to MultiSafepay and sent daily, weekly or monthly.
