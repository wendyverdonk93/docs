MultiSafepay is obliged by law (_De Wet ter voorkoming van witwassen en financieren van terrorisme_ or [Wwft](https://www.fiu-nederland.nl/en/legislation/general-legislation/wwft)) to perform monitoring on all our clients, including transaction monitoring. There are multiple reasons why MultiSafepay will request an invoice, for example:

* It is unclear what is being sold
* The order value is high 
* The order deviates from your customer profile.

Besides the invoice, additional questions can be asked for investigative purposes to be able to understand the transaction. If we are not able to understand the transaction after an investigation (e.g. when merchants are not cooperating with the requests), MultiSafepay might pause payouts or take other punitive measures.
