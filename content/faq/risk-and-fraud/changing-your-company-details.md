You must inform MultiSafepay of any changes to the form of your company or any other company details, e.g. address, director, UBO. 

* For changes of address, email the Support Team at <support@multisafepay.com>
* For changes in the company form, directors, or UBO, email the Risk Team at <risk@multisafepay.com> and include your MultiSafepay account number. 

MultiSafepay will request new documentation, such as UBO statements or copies of identification documents. 

If a different company is taking over your account, we recommend opening a **new** account to separate the money flow. Make sure you update all company details on the website(s), including company registration number, VAT number, and address. The company details on the website must match the details in your account.
