To enable [tokenization](/tools/tokenization/):

1. Sign in to your Magento 2 backend.
2. Go to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **MultiSafepay** > **MultiSafepay settings**.

### Credit cards
Tokenization is not available for the generic credit card gateway. You must enable the Visa, Mastercard, and/or Maestro gateways separately. This displays the **Save card** option at checkout.
