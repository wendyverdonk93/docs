Our partner Twikey offers an online tool for managing and collecting subscriptions that includes [SEPA direct debit mandate management](https://www.twikey.com/solution/mandate.html).

Customers can complete payments via:

- A MultiSafepay payment link added to your invoice
- A one-off payment link or QR code sent via Twikey, e.g. by email, WhatsApp, SMS

To integrate with MultiSafepay, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Twikey account.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **MultiSafepay**.
3. Enter your [MultiSafepay API key](/getting-started/set-up-your-account/user-guide/viewing-your-api-key/).
4. To add a payment link to your invoices, update your invoice settings in your [Twikey template settings](https://www.beta.twikey.com/support/creditor/invoices/invoice_options.html).
5. To create a payment link, go to [Payment links](https://www.beta.twikey.com/support/creditor/paymentlinks/paymentlink_management.html) enter the relevant information, e.g. amount, customer.
