This page provides an overview of the onboarding process, where MultiSafepay checks and approves information submitted by merchants and partners applying for a live account:  

1. Check the [list of prohibited products and services](/account/prohibited-products-services/).
2. Complete the live account [sign up form](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/signup). 
3. Provide [documents and information about your company](/account/onboarding-process/#2-provide-documents-and-information).
4. Display [required information on your website](/account/onboarding-process/#required-information-on-your-website).  

MultiSafepay then performs [know your customer (KYC) checks](/account/kyc/). If approved, your account goes live.

For full guidance, see [Onboarding and go live](/account/onboarding-golive/).
