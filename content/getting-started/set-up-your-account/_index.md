This page provides an overview of setting up your MultiSafepay test account:  

1. [Add at least one website](/account/adding-websites/).
2. [Generate an API key](/account/site-id-api-key-secure-code/). 
3. [Add users](/account/adding-users/).
4. [Connect your website to your backend](/account/connecting-websites-to-backend/).
5. [Activate your selected payment methods](/account/activating-payment-methods/).

Then, consider:  

- [Adding a financial email address](/account/adding-financial-email-address/) for us to send invoices to. 
- [Enabling two-factor authentication](/account/enabling-2FA/) for an additional layer of security for your account.
- [Setting your notification URL](/account/setting-your-notification-url/) for us to send notifications about orders.
- [Downloading the MultiSafepay app](/account/multisafepay-app/) to manage your account on the go.
