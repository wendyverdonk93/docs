Payment components are building blocks for embedding payment methods directly into your checkout page that:

- Provide a seamless checkout experience to increase conversion.
- Encrypt customer payment details for secure processing.
- Shift responsibility for [PCI DSS compliance](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#payment-card-industry-data-security-standard-pci-dss) to MultiSafepay.

## Integration

Integrate a payment component for:

### Multiple payment methods

First, within your checkout, the customer selects one of the available payment methods. 

Then, depending on the selected method, the customer fills out the payment details form in your checkout or is redirected to the relevant payment page.

### Single payment method

Embed a payment method of choice in your checkout. The customer completes the payment within your checkout or is redirected to the relevant payment page.

## Customization

You can customize the look of the payment component to match your brand's visual identity, and set the display language.
