Adding a payment fee or [Surcharge](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#surcharge) is no longer supported within the settings of the MultiSafepay plugin for OpenCart.

However, a patch can be requested. This will allow you to still add a payment fee or surcharge within the desired payment method.

Please keep in mind that the Payment Services Directive 2, also called PSD2, is now in place and may have implications on your webshop. PSD2 was first released in 2015 by the European Commission. This directive compelled the Member State to effectively intervene and regulate the payment service industry. See how applying payment fees or surcharges for your customers may affect your webshop on our [PSD2 documentation page](/faq/payment-regulations/payment-service-directive-2)
