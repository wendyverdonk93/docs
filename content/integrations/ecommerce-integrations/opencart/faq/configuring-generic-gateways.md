The OpenCart plugin supports [generic gateways](/faq/general/generic-gateways/) for all payment methods.  

To configure generic gateways, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your OpenCart backend.
2. Go to **Plugin settings** > **Payment methods** tab.
3. Set the:  
    - Gateway code  
    - Gateway logo  
    - Gateway label  
    - Whether to include the shopping cart in refunds. Required for billing suite gateway codes.

You can also set a custom initial order status.

You can filter generic gateways by:

* Geographic zone
* Currency
* Minimum amount
* Maximum amount
* Customer groups

Full refunds, partial refunds (except for billing suite payment methods), and backend orders are fully supported.
