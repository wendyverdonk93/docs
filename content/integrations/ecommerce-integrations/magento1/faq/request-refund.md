Yes, it is possible to refund orders or process a credit memo from the backend. Follow these steps:

1. Please ensure an [API key](/faq/general/glossary/#api-key) has been provided under _System_ > _Connect Settings_ and that the option Credit Memo has been enabled
2. Go to the order in the Magento backend for which you’d like to issue a refund
3. Click the _Invoices_ tab on the left of the _Order Overview_
4. Open the invoice, and click on _Credit memo_ located at the top right of the overview
5. Once the desired refunds/adjustments have been provided and made, click on _Refund Online_ so we can receive the request.

Further information on issuing a refund available in the [Magento 1](https://docs.magento.com/m1/ce/user_guide/order-processing/credit-memo-create.html) user guide. 

> Issuing a refund for AfterPay, Klarna, Pay After Delivery, Betaal per Maand or E-Invoicing in the Magento 1 ecommerce platform is possible. However, this can only be processed by selecting an item. It is not possible to credit an amount from the Magento 1 backend.

**Warning: If an amount is specified instead of an item selected, the entire order will be refunded.**
