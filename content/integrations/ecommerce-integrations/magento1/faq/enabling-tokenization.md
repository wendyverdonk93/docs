To enable tokenization in your backend:

1. Log in to your Magento 1 backend.
2. Go to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **MultiSafepay** > **MultiSafepay settings**.

For more information, see [Tokenization](/tools/tokenization/tokenization-api-level).

### Credit cards
Tokenization is not available for the generic credit card gateway. You must enable the Visa, Mastercard, and/or Maestro gateways separately to use tokenization. This displays the **Save card** option at checkout.
