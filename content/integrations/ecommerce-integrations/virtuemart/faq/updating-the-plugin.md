To update the plugin in your backend, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a backup of your production environment, and that you test the plugin in a staging environment.
2. From the [VirtueMart manual](/integrations/virtuemart/manual), download the plugin again.
3. Follow the Installation and configuration instructions from step 2.
