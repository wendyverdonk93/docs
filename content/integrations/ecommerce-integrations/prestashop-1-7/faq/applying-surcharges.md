Applying [surcharges](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#surcharge) or payment fees is not automatically supported in our PrestaShop 1.7 plugin.

## Support
The Integration Team will do their best to support you, but bear in mind that it is a third-party package. We can't guarantee perfect compatibility.

## PSD2 implications
For more information about how the Payment Services Directive 2 may affect surcharges or payment fees, see [Payment Services Directive 2](/faq/payment-regulations/payment-service-directive-2).
