MultiSafepay supports sending messages (Second Chance emails, links, order confirmation) and shows the payment page to the customer in several languages. 

However, Wordpress - WooCommerce only delivers us the language of the shop itself, no matter what the language or country of the customer is; or the current language of the store for the customer if you are using any third party plugin to have a multi language webshop. 

The MultiSafepay plugin for WooCommerce defines the language of the payment page and the language of the emails taking the locale code from get_locale(), which is a function built in Wordpress.

If you want to change this behavior it is possible using the filter hook “multisafepay_customer_locale” built in our plugin.

Ask your developer to read:

+ [Filters in Wordpress](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/filters/)
+ [What does Locale do?](https://docs.multisafepay.com/faq/api/locale/)

&nbsp;

A simple example of how to implement this will be the following: 

``` 
add_filter('multisafepay_customer_locale', 'return_my_own_locale');
function return_my_own_locale($locale) {
  // Your conditions and logic to return a valid locale code
  return $custom_locale;
}
```
