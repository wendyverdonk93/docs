Yes, it is possible to refund orders or credit memos from within the Magento 2 backend.  

In the Magento backoffice, go to the _Invoices_ tab, click on the invoice that was created by MultiSafepay, and then click _Credit Memo_. Now you see 2 refund buttons:
* Offline refund: refund request will not be sent to MultiSafepay
* Refund: a refund request will be sent to MultiSafepay.

You can also refund from your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)

{{< blue-notice >}}
If you have upgraded from the deprecated plugin to the new one, refunding orders with payment methods from the deprecated plugin is not possible inside Magento. These orders can be refunded via [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) instead.

Refunding from the Magento 2 backend is disabled when the order has a Fooman Surcharge. It is still possible to refund those orders through [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)
