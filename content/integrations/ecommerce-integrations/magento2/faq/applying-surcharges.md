Applying [surcharges](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#surcharge) or payment fees is no longer supported in the Magento 2 plugin.

## Using Fooman
To apply a surcharge or payment fee to a payment method, you can use the third-party [Fooman](https://store.fooman.co.nz/extensions/magento2) package.

You can refund orders with a Fooman surchage applied in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), but not from your Magento 2 backend. 

## Support
The Integration Team will do their best to support you with installing Fooman, but bear in mind that it is a third-party package. We can't guarantee perfect compatibility.

## PSD2 implications
For more information about how the Payment Services Directive 2 may affect surcharges or payment fees, see [Payment Services Directive 2](/faq/payment-regulations/payment-service-directive-2).
