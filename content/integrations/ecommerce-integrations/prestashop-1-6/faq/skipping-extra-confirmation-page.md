PrestaShop 1.6 version 3.1.7 let you skip the extra confirmation page so that the customer is redirected straight to the MultiSafepay payment page.

This is no longer supported from version 3.2.0. If you want to skip the extra confirmation page, you can [download version 3.1.7](/integrations/prestashop-1-6/releases/Plugin_PrestaShop1.6_3.1.7.zip). New features might be lost when downgrading.
