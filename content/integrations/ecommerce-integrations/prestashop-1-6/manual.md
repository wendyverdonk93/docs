### 1. Requirements
- PrestaShop 1.6
- Tested on PHP 7.0

### 2. Integration
1. Unpack the contents of the .zip archive and upload the "modules" folder via SFTP to the PrestaShop root directoy, merging the two folders.

### 3. Configuration
1. Navigate to the backend of your webshop and navigate to _Modules and Services > Payments and Gateways_

_It is essential that the MultiSafepay Core Module (MultiSafepay) is installed and configured. Reason being that all payment methods are more or less dependent on settings and/or the API key in the core module_

2. In the next screen proceed with the installation

3. Set your [API key](/faq/general/multisafepay-glossary/#api-key) and save the page. {{% account_info %}}
