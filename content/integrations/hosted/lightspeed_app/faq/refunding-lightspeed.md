Yes, you can refund orders as well as credit notes. By default, you can create a refund in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) However, refunds issued from the MultiSafepay Control will not be reflected in your Lightspeed backend.

To allow refunds from the Lightspeed backend, you first have to enable the following setting. Log in to [lightspeed.multisafepay.com](https://lightspeed.multisafepay.com/settings) and scroll down to _Enable Refunds_ or click _Enable Refunds_ in the sidebar.
