Yes you can refund orders. By default you can create a refund in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com), however, refunding directly from your Lightspeed backend is possible when cancelling an order. We intent to allow credit notes in the future.

To allow refunds you first have to enable this setting. Login to [lightspeed.multisafepay.com](https://lightspeed.multisafepay.com/settings), scroll down to "Enable Refunds" or click "Enable refunds" in the sidebar and here you can enable refunds. 

If you need any help with refunds, feel free to contact us!
