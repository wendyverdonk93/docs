This feature will be released in 1.0.11

When using built-in Lightspeed payment methods, icons will appear in the footer when an payment method is enabled. Apps do not support this by default.

You can add ask your developer to add the images to your theme or you can add them by yourself.

To help you, we have created a script which can automatically add the icons. Please note that that every theme can be different and you may have to make some changes for it to function.

In order to obtain the script, go to the Settings page of our app. Below Footer icons, you will find a generated script button. This will output a script in the text area below. Copy this script.
Go to your Lightspeed Admin area, Settings, Web extras and Custom Javascript. Paste the script into the Javascripts textbox, set the status to enable and click save. Icons should now be visible in the footer.

The generated icons update depending on the storefront and are ordered depending on the setting at the time of generation. If you update the settings, you would have to update the script as well.
