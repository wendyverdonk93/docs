In early 2021, we have changed the login method for the MultiSafepay Payment app for Lightspeed eCom. The old login method was password-based, while the new method uses the single sign-on provided by Lightspeed. This means you can directly log in via the Lightspeed eCom store to our settings page of the app.

To log in using the new method you have to use our app store page. Login to the /admin section of your Lightspeed store. 

- Go to apps in de side bar

- Click on the name of our app, MultiSafepay Payments.

- This should open the app store page, Alternatively paste "/admin/store/apps/1517" after the base url of your store. This should bring you to the store page immediately.
- On the store page click on "Go to app" / "Ga naar app" and you will be able to access your settings page.

While a login button is present, this one does not work.
