### Introduction
This is a beta version of the Lightspeed app. Please contact the Integration team at <integration@multisafepay.com> if you wish to use the app. The core Lightspeed integration can be found [here](https://docs.multisafepay.com/integrations/hosted/lightspeed_core)

{{% introduction_hosted "Lightspeed" %}}

### Requirements
The application is tested using the default, one-step and one-page checkout using the default theme.

For the optimal experience of the user, we included some Javascript and use our own images. This allows us to add, for example, a drop-down for iDEAL and our own icons for other payment methods. Some themes or users added scripts may cause issues, such as missing images for payment methods. To resolve these issues, a developer may be required.

If the Javascript files are not loaded, all payment methods will continue to work. If you want to use our payment icons, you can find them on our [Github page](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/MultiSafepay-icons)

To use the app, an API key is required. To obtain this key you need a MultiSafepay account. You can create a test account on https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/signup
