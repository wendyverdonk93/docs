Yes, it is possible to refund orders or credit memos from within the Magento 2 backend.  

In the Magento backoffice, go to the _Invoices_ tab, click on the invoice that was created by MultiSafepay, and then click _Credit Memo_. Now you see 2 refund buttons:
* Offline refund: refund request will not be sent to MultiSafepay
* Refund: a refund request will be sent to MultiSafepay.

You can also refund from your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)

If you have more questions about refunds, please check out our [FAQ on refunds](/faq/refunds).

_Note: Refunding from the Magento 2 backend is disabled when the order has a Fooman Surcharge. It is still possible to refund those orders through [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com)_
