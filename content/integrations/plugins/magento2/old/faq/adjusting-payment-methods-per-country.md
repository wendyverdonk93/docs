Yes, it is possible to adjust the payment methods when changing the billing address on the checkout page. By default, the payment selection is not adjusted per country unless you change the settings in the backend of Magento 2:

1. Go to _Stores_ → _Sales_ → _Checkout_ → _Checkout Options_
2. Locate _Display Billing Address On (store view)_
3. Select _Payment Page_
4. Save settings.

_Please note that this only applies for Magento 2.3.4 Community - Plugin 1.14.0_
