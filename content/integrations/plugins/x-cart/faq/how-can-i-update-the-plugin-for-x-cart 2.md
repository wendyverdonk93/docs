Generally, there are three ways to update a plugin. This can be done through the backend and through the marketplace from a CMS or through SFTP. However, we will be describing the necessary steps via the backend of X-Cart.

* Make sure you have a backup of your production environment
* Test the plugin in a staging environment.

Go to our [Manual](/integrations/plugins/x-cart/) page, download the plugin and follow the instructions from step 1.
