When no external shipping method is used within the PrestaShop 1.7 plugin the _My carrier_ should be enabled.

Follow the instructions within the PrestaShop 1.7 to enable the standard shipping method, _my carrier_.

_Payment method_ → _Preferences_ → Enable MultiSafepay in the _my carrier_ within the Carrier Restrictions.

_The carrier should always be activated within the payment preference of MultiSafepay. When disabled, no payment methods will be shown in the frontend of the webshop_.
