The PrestaShop 1.6 version 3.1.7 allows you to skip the extra confirmation page due to a workaround. The customer will be redirected to the payment page of MultiSafepay without the verification of the confirmation page.

This is no longer supported within the PrestaShop 1.6 version 3.2.0. When desired, you can skip the extra confirmation page by downloading the PrestaShop 1.6 version 3.1.7.

Do mind that new features might be lost when downgrading from PrestaShop 1.6 version 3.2.0.
