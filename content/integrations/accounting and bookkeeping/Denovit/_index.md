### MultiSafepay payment link in Exact invoices by Denovit 

It is possible to have a payment link automatically inserted in your Exact invoices by using [Denovit payment link module](https://www.denovit.nl/Exact-PaymentLink)

To set it up, you need to log into your Denovit account, go to your Dashboard and select the Paylink module. After connecting to your Exact account,  in the PSP settings you have to insert your [MultiSafepay API key](https://docs.multisafepay.com/tools/multisafepay-control/get-your-api-key) and your payment conditions as used in Exact. Furthermore, you can adjust other settings to personalize your e-mail template, thank you page and your notification e-mail to make your customer experience better. From now on, every time you “E-mail” or “Print and process” an invoice in Exact after creating it, an e-mail will be sent with a payment link and your customers will be able to pay quickly and conveniently.

If you use the “E-mail” function, an additional e-mail will be sent with a payment link to the current e-mail. In case of “Print and process”, only an e-mail with a payment link will be sent.
