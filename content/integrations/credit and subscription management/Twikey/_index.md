### Subscription and credit management tool
Twikey is an online tool for managing your subscriptions and collecting your subscription fees that includes [SEPA direct debit mandate management](https://www.twikey.com/solution/mandate.html)

### Include MultiSafepay payment link
You can send invoices directly to your new and existing customers by including a MultiSafepay link and thus enabling your customers to pay quickly and effortlessly by clicking on a MultiSafepay payment link. It is also possible to create a one-off payment link to send to your customers via Twikey to collect payments for unsettled transactions by allowing the customer to pay by clicking on a payment link or scanning a QR code that you can send by e-mail, WhatsApp or any other means of communication that you might use.

To use these features, you need to set up your the integration with MultiSafepay by entering your [MultiSafepay API key](https://docs.multisafepay.com/tools/multisafepay-control/get-your-api-key) in Twikey by going to  _Settings_ -> _Integrations_ -> _MultiSafepay_. After that, you need to update your invoice settings in your [Twikey template settings](https://www.beta.twikey.com/support/creditor/invoices/invoice_options.html) if you want a payment link added when sending invoices. In case you want to create a payment link, you simply need to go to the [Payment links](https://www.beta.twikey.com/support/creditor/paymentlinks/paymentlink_management.html)  section and input the necessary information as amount, customer identification etc.
